The code is used for calculating the current of single-expressed variants with WT. The file naming format is like 001AC_C01F10P1_20210101.
The origin_Vcotest.m is used to calculate the half-activated voltages of all traces in one file.
The main.m is used to calculate the half-activated voltages automatically in main file which contains different files full of traces.
