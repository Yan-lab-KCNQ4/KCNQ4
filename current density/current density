The code is used to load abf format files and further calculate current density and other values.
The file name format must follow the file name listed below '001AC_C01F02P3_20200101.abf'. 
The '001AC' means the first amino acid Ala was mutated to Cys. 
The 'C01F02P3' means the first cell you recorded, the cell capacitance and the procedure you used.
The '20200101' means the date when you recorded the current.
The test_origin.m is used to calculate the current amplitudes of all traces in one file.
The main.m is used to calculate the current amplitudes automatically in main file which contains different files full of traces.
