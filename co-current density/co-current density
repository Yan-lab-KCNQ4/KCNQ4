The code is used for calculating the current of co-expressed variants with WT. The file naming format is like 001AC_WT_C01F10P1_20210101.
The origin_cotest.m is used to calculate the currents amplitudes of all traces in one file.
The main.m is used to calculate the currents amplitudes automatically in main file which contains different files full of traces.
